This example shows how a more complex chart can be built using the d3fc components.

The three charts that make up this example are each {{{ hyperlink 'cartesian.html' title='cartesian charts' }}}. The top-most chart uses the {{{ hyperlink 'gridlines.html' title='gridlines' }}}, {{{ hyperlink 'crosshair.html' title='crosshairs' }}} and {{{ hyperlink 'candlestick.html' title='candlestick' }}} components, rendered via the {{{ hyperlink 'multi.html' title='multi-series' }}} component. The volume and navigator charts uses a similar mix of components.

These charts all share the same underlying data, however, this is enhanced with the data that represents the current interactive state.

The top-most chart uses a tooltip component that is added as a 'decoration' of the crosshair.
