This example is a recreation of [Mike Bostock's recreation](http://bost.ocks.org/mike/nations/) of Gapminderâ€™s [Wealth &amp; Health of Nations](http://www.gapminder.org/world/).

> It shows the dynamic fluctuation in per-capita income (x), life expectancy (y) and population (radius) of 180 nations over the last 209 years. Nations are colored by geographic region; mouseover to read their names.

Mousing-over the year, in the bottom-right corner of the chart, enables interaction and moves the year displayed forwards and backwards through time.
