An [Exponential Moving Average](https://en.wikipedia.org/?title=Moving_average#Exponential_moving_average) (EMA) is an indicator that smooths out fluctuations in data.

The example below creates a point series and an EMA:

```js
{{{ codeblock ema-example-js }}}
```

{{{ dynamic-include 'codepen' html="ema-example-html" js="ema-example-js" }}}

{{{ema-example-html}}}
<script type="text/javascript">
{{{ema-example-js}}}
</script>

You can configure the number of datapoints that are included in the moving average via the `windowSize` property, you can also change the object property that is averaged via the `yValue` property.
