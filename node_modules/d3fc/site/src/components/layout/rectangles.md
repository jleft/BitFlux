The rectangles layout component provides a mechanism for arranging child components based on their rectangular bounding boxes. It is typically used to render tooltips or labels on a chart, but can also be used to render labels on maps. A layout strategy can be passed to the component in order to arrange the child rectangles avoiding collisions. A filter function can also be applied in order to remove overlaps or post-process the layout.

The `size` and `position` of each child can be specified via constants or as accessor functions of the underlying bound data. The rectangles layout component operates in the screen coordinate system, hence these values are both in pixels.

The component has `xScale` and `yScale` properties, which are provided as a convenient mechanism for determining the overall bounding box when used in conjunction with a {{{ hyperlink 'cartesian.html' title='cartesian chart' }}}.

The following example shows how a number of labels can be arranged by this layout component:

```js
{{{codeblock rectangles-example-js}}}
```

Which is rendered as follows:

{{{ dynamic-include 'codepen' html="rectangles-example-html" js="rectangles-example-js" css="rectangles-example-css"}}}

<style>
{{{rectangles-example-css}}}
</style>

{{{rectangles-example-html}}}
<script type="text/javascript">
{{{rectangles-example-js}}}
</script>

NOTE: The rectangles layout component sets the `layout-width` and `layout-height` attributes of the generated child component containers, this allows the child component to use {{{ hyperlink 'flexbox.html' title='flexbox layout' }}}.

In the above example the width and height of each rectangle is hard coded, which is not ideal for text labels. The following example measures bounding box for each item of text so that its rectangular container tightly 'hugs' the text.

This example also makes use of the `fc.layout.strategy.removeOverlaps` strategy that is applied as a `filter` in order to cull labels that overlap:

```js
{{{codeblock rectangles-example-measure-js}}}
```

{{{ dynamic-include 'codepen' html="rectangles-example-measure-html" js="rectangles-example-measure-js" css="rectangles-example-css"}}}

{{{rectangles-example-measure-html}}}
<script type="text/javascript">
{{{rectangles-example-measure-js}}}
</script>

There are a number of strategies that can be used to resolve overlaps, these include:

 + `greedy` - The greedy strategy adds each rectangle in sequence, selecting the position where the rectangle has the lowest overlap with already added rectangles and is inside the container.
 + `annealing` - The simulated annealing layout strategy runs over a set number of iterations, choosing a different location for one rectangle on each iteration. If that location results in a better result, it is saved for the next iteration. Otherwise, it is saved with probability inversely proportional with the iteration it is currently on. This helps it break out of local optimums, hopefully producing better output. Because of the random nature of the algorithm, it produces variable output. The `temperature` parameter indicates the initial 'number' to use for the random probability calculation, and `cooling` defines the delta of the temperature between iterations. The algorithm runs for `Math.ceil(temperature / cooling)` iterations.
 + `boundingBox`- The bounding box layout strategy moves a rectangle if it leaves the container. It does no overlap correction.
 + `local` - The local search layout strategy tries to resolve rectangle overlaps. It attempts to move each rectangle with an overlap to another potential placement with a better overlap.
